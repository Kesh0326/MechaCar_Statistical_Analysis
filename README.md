## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Based on the linear regression model and significance level of 5%, the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on the mpg of the vehicle. 
- Also, the r-squared value is 0.715 meaning roughly 72% of all the mpg predictions will be correct when using this model
- The p-value is of our linear regression analysis is much smaller than our significance level, so there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis meaning the slope of the linear model is not zero
